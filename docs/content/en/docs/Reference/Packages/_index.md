  This section contains documentation for core packages present in the cOS toolkit repositories
---

There are a set of core packages available in the cOS repositories which are installable with `luet` while creating a derivative in the Dockerfile. Those bring in new features, enhancements and core features of the cOS toolkit. Some are optional (like runtime features) while some of them are strictly necessary in order for a cOS system to boot and operate correctly. 

This section contains reference documentation specific to core packages in the cOS repositories and the functionalities they bring.

All the packages available can also be browsed [here](https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/cos-toolkit-package-browser/).
