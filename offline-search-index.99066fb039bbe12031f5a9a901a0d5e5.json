Elemental assets can be used to either drive unattended deployments of a derivative or used to create custom images (with packer).\nPhilosophy Philosophy behind elemental-toolkit is simple: it allows you to create Linux derivatives from container images.\nContainer registry as a single source of truth Hybrid way to access your image for different scopes (development, debugging, ..) No more inconsistent states between nodes. A “Store” to keep your (tagged) shared states where you can rollback and upgrade into. “Stateless”: Images with upgrades are rebuilt from scratch instead of applying upgrades. A/B upgrades, immutable systems The container image is booted as-is, encapsulating all the needed components (kernel, initrd included) and can be pulled locally for inspection, development and debugging. At the same time it can be used also to create installation medium as ISO, Raw images, OVA or Cloud specific images.\nA derivative automatically inherits the following featureset:\nCan upgrade to another container image Can deploy a system from scratch from an image Reset or recovery to a specific image Customize the image during runtime to persist changes across reboots Perform an installation from the LiveCD medium Building Elemental derivatives The starting point to use elemental-toolkit is to check out our examples and our creating bootable images section.\nThe only requirement to build derivatives with elemental-toolkit is Docker installed. If you are interested in building elemental-toolkit itself, see Development notes.\nThe toolkit itself is delivered as a set of standalone, re-usable OCI artifacts which are tagged and tracked as standard OCI images and it is installed inside the container image to provide the same featureset among derivatives, see how to create bootable images.\nVanilla images Elemental releases are composed of vanilla images that are used internally for testing and can be used as a starting point to deploy derivatives in specific environments (e.g. AWS) or just to try out the Elemental featureset.\nThe vanilla images ships no specific business-logic aside serving as a base for testing and deploying other derivatives.\nWhat to do next? Check out how to create bootable images or download the Elemental vanilla images to give Elemental a try!\nHere below you will find the common documentation that applies to any derivative built with Elemental and the Elemental vanilla images.\n","categories":"","description":"Getting started with Elemental\n","excerpt":"Getting started with Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":"Elemental (or any Elemental derivative built with elemental-toolkit) can be installed with elemental install:\nelemental install [options] \u003cdevice\u003e Option Description –cloud-init string Cloud-init config file –cosign Enable cosign verification (requires images with signatures) –cosign-key string Sets the URL of the public key to be used by cosign validation –eject-cd Try to eject the cd on reboot, only valid if booting from iso –firmware string Firmware to install for (’esp’ or ‘bios’) (default “efi”) –force Force install –help help for install –iso string Performs an installation from the ISO url –no-format Don’t format disks.

(For more info about keyless signing/verification check here)\nThis signature generation is provided by luet-cosign which is a luet plugin that generates the signatures on image push when building, and verifies them on package unpack when installing/upgrading/deploying.\nThe process is completely transparent to the end user when upgrading/deploying a running system and using our published artifacts.\nWhen using luet-cosign as part of luet install you need to set COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 so it can use keyless verification\nDerivatives If building a derivative, you can also sign and verify you final artifacts with the use of luet-cosign.\nAs keyless is only possible to do in an CI environment (as it needs an OIDC token) you would need to set up private/public signature and verification.\nNote If you are building and publishing your derivatives with luet on github, you can see an example on how we generate and push the keyless signatures ourselves on this workflow Verify elemental-toolkit artifacts as part of derivative building If you consume elemental-toolkit artifacts in your Dockerfile as part of building a derivative you can verify the signatures of the artifacts by setting:\nENV COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 RUN luet install -y meta/cos-verify # install dependencies for signature checking Note The\nmeta/cos-verify is a meta package that will pull\ntoolchain/cosign and\ntoolchain/luet-cosign .\nAnd then making sure you call luet with --plugin luet-cosign. You can see an example of this in our standard Dockerfile example\nThat would verify the artifacts coming from our repository.\nFor signing resulting containers with a private/public key, please refer to the cosign documents.\nFor verifying with a private/public key, the only thing you need is to set the env var COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_LOCATION to point to the public key that signed and enable the luet-cosign plugin.\nNote Currently there is an issue in which if there is more than one repo and one of those repos is not signed the whole install will fail due to cosign failing to verify the unsigned repo.\nIf you are using luet with one or more unsigned repos, it’s not possible to use cosign to verify the chain.\nPlease follow up in https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/luet-cosign/issues/6 for more info.\n","categories":"","description":"How we use cosign in elemental-toolkit\n","excerpt":"How we use cosign in elemental-toolkit\n","ref":"/docs/creating-derivatives/cosign/","tags":"","title":"Cosign"},{"body":" Each Elemental release contains a variety of assets:\nISOs cOS-Seed-teal-$VERSION-$ARCH.iso.tar.xz QCOW cOS-Packer-teal_$VERSION-QEMU-$ARCH.tar.gz.tar.xz OVA cOS-Packer-teal_$VERSION-vbox-$ARCH.tar.gz.tar.xz Vagrant box (vbox provider) cOS-Packer-teal-$VERSION-vbox-$ARCH.box.tar.xz Vagrant box (qemu provider) cOS-Packer-teal-$VERSION-QEMU-$ARCH.box.tar.xz RAW Disk cOS-Vanilla-RAW-$VERSION-$ARCH.raw.tar.xz VHD cOS-Vanilla-AZURE-$VERSION-$ARCH.vhd.tar.xz GCE cOS-Vanilla-GCE-teal-$VERSION-$ARCH.raw.tar.xz here we try to summarize and document how they are meant to be consumed.\nISO ISO images (e.g. ``cOS-Seed-teal-$VERSION-$ARCH.iso.tar.xz` ) are shipping a Elemental vanilla image and they feature an installer to perform an automated installation. They can be used to burn USB sticks or CD/DVD used to boot baremetals. Once booted, you can install cOS with:\nelemental install $DEVICE See also [../install] for installation options.\nAfter the first boot you can also switch to a derivative by:\nelemental upgrade --verify --system.uri $IMAGE Booting from network You can boot a cOS squashfs by using a native iPXE implementation on your system or by inserting a custom build iPXE iso by using your either your servers management web-interface (ILO, iDrac, …) or using a redfish library or its vendor specific implementation (e.g. ilorest).\nTo boot from IPXE you need to extract the squashfs from images with the cos-img-recovery- prefix. By pulling the image, saving it using docker save, then unpack the single layer in the file to an extra directory and then run\n$\u003e mksquashfs \u003cpath_to_folder\u003e \u003coutput_path\u003e/root.squashfs Note: The squashfs file can also be extracted using the following docker command:\n$\u003e docker run -v $PWD:/Elemental --entrypoint /usr/bin/luet -ti --rm quay.io/costoolkit/toolchain util unpack quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal:cos-img-recovery-\u003cversion\u003e .

The resulting iso can be found in src/bin/ipxe.iso and should be ~1MB in size.\nVirtual machines For booting into Virtual machines we offer QCOW2, OVA, and raw disk recovery images which can be used to bootstrap your booting container.\nQCOW2 QCOW2 images ( e.g. cOS-Packer-teal-$VERSION-QEMU-$ARCH.tar.gz.tar.xz ) contains a pre-installed Elemental system which can be booted via QEMU, e.g:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -hda cOS -nographic OVA Ova images ( e.g. cOS-Packer-teal-$VERSION-vbox-$ARCH.tar.gz.tar.xz ) contains a pre-installed Elemental system which can be booted via vbox. Please check the virtuabox docs on how to create a new VM with an existing disk.\nVagrant Download the vagrant box artifact ( e.g. cOS-Packer-teal-$VERSION-{vbox, QEMU}-$ARCH.box.tar.xz ), extract it and run:\nvagrant box add cos \u003ccos-box-image\u003e vagrant init cos vagrant up RAW disk images RAW disk images ( e.g. cOS-Vanilla-RAW-teal-$VERSION-$ARCH.raw.tar.xz ) contains only the Elemental recovery system.

Then you can snapshot that VM into a VM image ready to deploy with the default Elemental system or your derivative.\nAt the moment we support Azure and AWS images among our artifacts. We publish AWS images that can also be re-used in packer templates for creating customized AMI images.\nThe RAW image can then be used into packer templates to generate custom Images, or used as-is with a userdata to deploy a container image of choice with an input user-data.\nImport an AWS image manually You can also use RAW images ( e.g. cOS-Vanilla-RAW-teal-$VERSION-$ARCH.raw.tar.xz ) manually when importing AMIs images and use them to generate images with Packer.

This section describes the requirements to create a container image that can be run by Elemental.\nRequirements Bootable images are standard container images, that means the usual build and push workflow applies, and building images is also a way to persist oem customizations.\nThe base image can be any Linux distribution that is compatible with our flavors.\nThe image needs to ship:\nparts of the elemental-toolkit (required, see below) kernel (required) initrd (required) grub (required) dracut (optional, kernel and initrd can be consumed from the Elemental repositories) microcode (optional, not required in order to boot, but recomended) cosign and luet-cosign packages (optional, required if you want to verify the images installed by luet) Example An illustrative example can be:\nARG LUET_VERSION=0.32.0 FROM quay.io/luet/base:$LUET_VERSION AS luet FROM quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal:cos-system-0.8.10-1 ENV COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 ARG ARCH=amd64 ENV ARCH=${ARCH} ENV LUET_NOLOCK=true # Copy the luet config file pointing to the upgrade repository COPY conf/luet.yaml /etc/luet/luet.yaml # Copy luet from the official images COPY --from=luet /usr/bin/luet /usr/bin/luet RUN luet install -y meta/cos-verify RUN luet install --plugin luet-cosign -y meta/cos-light \\ utils/k9s \\ utils/nerdctl \\ toolchain/elemental-cli COPY files/ / RUN mkinitrd Complete source code: https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit/blob/main/examples/standard/Dockerfile With the config file:\nlogging: color: false enable_emoji: false general: debug: false spinner_charset: 9 repositories: - name: \"cos\" description: \"cOS official\" type: \"docker\" enable: true cached: true priority: 1 verify: false urls: - \"quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal\" Complete source code: https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit/blob/main/examples/standard/conf/luet.yaml In the example above, the elemental-toolkit parts that are required are pulled in by RUN luet install -y meta/cos-minimal. Afterwards we install k9s and nerdctl packages to create our derivative with those packages on it.\nMeta packages The toolkit is split into several meta-packages to pull only the individual needed part or a subset of them which are tied to a specific purpose, the meta packages are documented in their own section.\nmeta/cos-minimal is a meta-package that will pull toolchain/luet , toolchain/yip , utils/installer , system/cos-setup , system/immutable-rootfs , system/base-dracut-modules , system/grub2-config , system/cloud-config .\nMinimal Core Light Toolchain # This meta package will pull the minimal set to have a bootable system. # This includes default username/password set as well (`root/cos`) during boot RUN luet install -y meta/cos-minimal # The core subset includes the packages needed to have a bootable system. # This does not include any specific system configuration. RUN luet install -y meta/cos-core # Can be used in conjuction with others, to achieve the desired configuration RUN luet install -y meta/cos-core cloud-config/live cloud-config/network # The light subset includes the packages needed to have a bootable system, omitting any compiled binaries. # This does not include as well any specific system configuration. RUN luet install -y meta/cos-light # Can be used in conjuction with others, to achieve the desired configuration RUN luet install -y meta/cos-light meta/toolchain cloud-config/live cloud-config/network # The Toolchain subset includes only compiled binaries required into the rootfs image. # This does not include as well any specific system configuration. RUN luet install -y meta/toolchain # Can be used in conjuction with others, to achieve the desired configuration RUN luet install -y meta/cos-light meta/toolchain Note system/cloud-config is optional, but provides Elemental defaults setting, for example default user/password, rootfs layout, and more. If you are not installing it directly, an equivalent cloud-config or a set has to be provided in order to properly boot and run a system, see oem configuration. Individual cloud-configs can be installed as well as are available as standalone packages. Using cosign in your derivative The meta/cos-verify is a meta package that will pull toolchain/cosign and toolchain/luet-cosign .\ntoolchain/cosign and toolchain/luet-cosign are optional packages that would install cosign and luet-cosign in order to verify the packages installed by luet.\nYou can use cosign to both verify that packages coming from elemental-toolkit are verified and sign your own derivative artifacts\nNote If you want to manually verify cosign and luet-cosign packages before installing them with luet, you can do so by:\nInstall Cosign Export the proper vars export COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 for keyless verify Manually verify the signatures on both packages Check the latest $VERSION for both packages at the repo (i.e. https://quay.io/repository/costoolkit/releases-teal?tab=tags) cosign verify quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal:luet-cosign-toolchain-$VERSION cosign verify quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal:cosign-toolchain-$VERSION For more info, check the cosign page.\nInitrd The image should provide at least grub, systemd, dracut, a kernel and an initrd. Those are the common set of packages between derivatives. See also package stack. By default the initrd is expected to be symlinked to /boot/initrd and the kernel to /boot/vmlinuz, otherwise you can specify a custom path while building an iso and by customizing grub.\nsystem/base-dracut-modules is required to be installed with luet in case you are building manually the initrd from the Dockerfile and also to run dracut to build the initrd, the command might vary depending on the base distro which was chosen.\nsystem/kernel and system/dracut-initrd can also be installed if you plan to use kernels and initrd from the Elemental repositories and don’t build them / or install them from the official distro repositories (e.g. with zypper, or dnf or either apt-get…). In this case you don’t need to generate initrd on your own, neither install the kernel coming from the base image.\nBuilding The workflow would be then:\ndocker build the image docker push the image to some registry elemental upgrade --docker-image $IMAGE from a Elemental machine or (elemental reset if bootstrapping a cloud image) The following can be incorporated in any standard gitops workflow.\nYou can explore more examples in the example section on how to create bootable images.\nWhat’s next? Now that we have created our derivative container, we can either:\nBuild an iso Build an Amazon Image Build a Google Cloud Image ","categories":"","description":"This document describes the requirements to create standard container images that can be used for `Elemental` deployments\n","excerpt":"This document describes the requirements to create standard container …","ref":"/docs/creating-derivatives/creating_bootable_images/","tags":"","title":"Creating bootable images"},{"body":"Elemental and derivatives are immutable systems. That means that any change in the running OS will not persist after a reboot.\nWhile configurations can be persisted, there are occasions where installing a custom package or provide additional persistent files in the end system is needed.\nWe will see here a way to install packages, drivers, or apply any modification we might want to do in the OS image during runtime, without any need to rebuild the derivative container image. This will let any user (and not derivative developer) to apply any needed customization and to be able to persist across upgrades.\nTransient changes To apply transient changes, it’s possible to boot a Elemental derivative in read/write mode by specifying rd.cos.debugrw see here for more details. This allows to do any change and will persist into the active/passive booting system (does NOT apply for recovery). Altough this methodology should be only considered for debugging purposes.\nPersist changes with Cloud init files Note: The following applies only to derivatives with utils/installer at version 0.17 or newer\nElemental allows to apply a set of commands, or cloud-init steps, during upgrade, deploy, install and reset in the context of the target image, in RW capabilities. This allows to carry on changes during upgrades on the target image without the need to re-build or have a custom derivative image.\nAll the configuration that we want to apply to the system will run each time we do an upgrade, a reset or an installation on top of the new downloaded image (in case of upgrade) or the image which is the target system.\nBetween the available stages in the cloud-init there are after-upgrade-chroot, after-install-chroot, after-reset-chroot and after-deploy-chroot, for example, consider the following cloud-init file:\nstages: name: \"Install something\" stages: after-upgrade-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-reset-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-deploy-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-install-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... It will run the zypper in -y ... calls during each stage, in the context of the target system, allowing to customize the target image with additional packages.\nNote zypper calls here are just an example. We could have used dnf for fedora based, or apt-get for ubuntu based images. When running the cloud-init steps the /oem partition and /usr/local will be mounted to COS_OEM and COS_PERSISTENT respectively, allowing to load extra data (e.g. rpm files, or configuration).\nExample If an user wants to install an additional package in the running system, and keep having that persistent across upgrades, he can copy the following file (install.yaml) inside the /oem folder, or /usr/local/cloud-config:\nstages: name: \"Install something\" stages: after-upgrade-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y vim and run elemental upgrade.\nIt will automatically upgrade the system with the changes above included.\n","categories":"","description":"Applying changes to Elemental images in runtime or “how to install a package in an immutable OS at runtime?”\n","excerpt":"Applying changes to Elemental images in runtime or “how to install a …","ref":"/docs/customizing/runtime_persistent_changes/","tags":"","title":"Runtime persistent changes"},{"body":"Below is a reference of all keys available in the cloud-init style files.\nstages: # \"network\" is the stage where network is expected to be up # It is called internally when network is available from # the cos-setup-network unit. network: # Here there are a list of # steps to be run in the network stage - name: \"Some setup happening\" files: - path: /tmp/foo content: | test permissions: 0777 owner: 1000 group: 100 commands: - echo \"test\" modules: - nvidia environment: FOO: \"bar\" systctl: debug.exception-trace: \"0\" hostname: \"foo\" systemctl: enable: - foo disable: - bar start: - baz mask: - foobar authorized_keys: user: - \"github:mudler\" - \"ssh-rsa ....\" dns: path: /etc/resolv.conf nameservers: - 8.8.8.8 ensure_entities: - path: /etc/passwd entity: | kind: \"user\" username: \"foo\" password: \"pass\" uid: 0 gid: 0 info: \"Foo!\" homedir: \"/home/foo\" shell: \"/bin/bash\" delete_entities: - path: /etc/passwd entity: | kind: \"user\" username: \"foo\" password: \"pass\" uid: 0 gid: 0 info: \"Foo!\" homedir: \"/home/foo\" shell: \"/bin/bash\" datasource: providers: - \"aws\" - \"digitalocean\" path: \"/etc/cloud-data\" The default cloud-config format is split into stages (initramfs, boot, network, initramfs, reconcile, called generically STAGE_ID below) see also stages that are emitted internally during the various phases by calling cos-setup STAGE_ID. steps (STEP_NAME below) defined for each stage are executed in order.\nEach cloud-config file is loaded and executed only at the apprioriate stage, this allows further components to emit their own stages at the desired time.\nThe cloud-init tool can be also run standalone, this helps debugging locally and also during development, you can find separate releases here, or just run it with docker:\ncat \u003c\u003cEOF | docker run -i --rm quay.io/costoolkit/releases-teal:cos-recovery-0.8.10-3 yip -s test - stages: test: - commands: - echo \"test\" EOF Note: Each cloud-init option can be either run in dot notation ( e.g. stages.network[0].authorized_keys.user=github:user ) in the boot args or either can supply a cloud-init URL at boot with the cos.setup=$URL parameter.\nUsing templates With Cloud Init support, templates can be used to allow dynamic configuration. More information about templates can be found here and also here for sprig functions.\nCompatibility with Cloud Init format A subset of the official cloud-config spec is implemented.\nIf a yaml file starts with #cloud-config it is parsed as a standard cloud-init and automatically associated it to the boot stage. For example:\n#cloud-config growpart: mode: auto devices: ['/'] users: - name: \"bar\" passwd: \"foo\" lock_passwd: true uid: \"1002\" groups: \"users\" ssh_authorized_keys: - faaapploo ssh_authorized_keys: - asdd runcmd: - foo hostname: \"bar\" write_files: - encoding: b64 content: CiMgVGhpcyBmaWxlIGNvbnRyb2xzIHRoZSBzdGF0ZSBvZiBTRUxpbnV4 path: /foo/bar permissions: \"0644\" owner: \"bar\" Is executed at boot, by using the standard cloud-config format.\nNote You can’t mix extended syntax with legacy cloud-init syntax.

The config file reproduced here is meant to be included as a user-data in a cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure, etc) or as part of a cdrom (Elemental-Recovery will try to fetch /userdata file from a cdrom device).\nA vanilla image is an image that only provides the Elemental-Recovery system on a COS_RECOVERY partition. It does not include any other system and it is meant to be dumped to a bigger disk and deploy a Elemental system or a derivative system over the free space in disk. COS vanilla images are build as part of the CI workflow, see CI artifacts to download one of those.\nThe configuration file of this example has two purposes: first it deploys Elemental, second in reboots on the deployed OS and deploys K3S + Fleet + System Upgrades Controller.\nOn first boot it will fail to boot Elemental grub menu entry and fallback to Elemental-Recovery system. From there it will partition the vanilla image to create the main system partition (COS_STATE) and add an extra partition for persistent data (COS_PERSISTENT). It will use the full disk, a disk of at least 20GiB is recommended.

After the process completes, we should have a ISO in our folder ready to be used. See the build ISOs section for all the available options.\nCustomization Here follows a break down of the steps above\nAdding packages Feel free to edit the Dockerfile with the packages you want to embed in our image. You can install any packages available in the openSUSE repositories by tweaking\n# Install packages from the base image RUN zypper in -y \\ .... # Add more packages here! Repositories configuration We copy the configuration file of luet which just points to Elemental repositories with:\n# Copy the luet config file pointing to the upgrade repository COPY repositories.yaml /etc/luet/luet.yaml The config file should point to the teal flavor as our derivative will be based on SLE Micro. It should point to green, blue, or orange instead if building against Opensuse, Fedora or Ubuntu.\nElemental toolkit We install packages from the Elemental toolkit with luet. In this case we pick the basic ones that allows us to install/upgrade immutable Elemental derivatives:\nENV LUET_NOLOCK=true RUN luet install -y \\ toolchain/yip \\ toolchain/luet \\ utils/installer \\ system/cos-setup \\ system/immutable-rootfs \\ system/grub2-config \\ system/base-dracut-modules You can check all the available packages here, and you can learn more about this in our Creating Derivatives section.\nSystem layout and k3s We set some default layouts and install k3s:\n# Install k3s server/agent ENV INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=${K3S_VERSION} RUN curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io \u003e installer.sh \u0026\u0026 \\ INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=\"true\" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=\"true\" sh installer.sh \u0026\u0026 \\ INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=\"true\" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=\"true\" sh installer.sh agent \u0026\u0026 \\ rm -rf installer.sh ## System layout # Required by k3s etc. RUN mkdir /usr/libexec \u0026\u0026 touch /usr/libexec/.keep # Copy custom files # COPY files/ / # Generate initrd RUN mkinitrd # OS level configuration RUN echo \"VERSION=999\" \u003e /etc/os-release RUN echo \"GRUB_ENTRY_NAME=derivative\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release RUN echo \"welcome to our derivative\" \u003e\u003e /etc/issue.d/01-derivative As our target here is to install k3s we do install both k3s agent and server, so the image can work in both modes. Here we could have installed any service or binary that we want to embed in our container image. We setup the system layout by creating needed paths for k3s and set up a os-release which identifies the OS version. Afterward we regenerate the initrd which is required in order to boot, see also the Initrd section.\nCloud-init, custom SSH access The cloud-init.yaml file above configures a user, joe and attaches a ssh key to it in order to login. It also sets up a default password, which is optional.\nTo specify any additional ssh key installed within the user, we do:\nnetwork: - authorized_keys: joe: - github:mudler which you can replace with your github handle, or by specifying directly an ssh key. In case you specify the SSH key directly, you don’t need to run the step in the network stage.\nThe user will be part of the admin group which is allowed to use sudo.\nAs our target is to run k3s, but could have been any other service, we tweak the immutable setup by specifying sensible path required for k3s in order to function properly, see immutable rootfs for all the available options.\nFinally, we start k3s. Note, we could have tweaked that part slightly to provide k3s configurations via systemd env files, or boot up for example the agent instead of the server:\nnetwork: - if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' name: \"Setup k3s\" # Setup environment file for custom k3s arguments environment_file: \"/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.env\" environment: FOO: \"bar\" systemctl: start: - k3s - commands: - | chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.env ","categories":"","description":"This document is a step-by-step guide to build a customized embedded system that can be used in Elemental\n","excerpt":"This document is a step-by-step guide to build a customized embedded …","ref":"/docs/examples/embedded_images/","tags":"","title":"Creating embedded images"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"This section contains various articles relative on how to customize Elemental, branding and behavior.\n","excerpt":"This section contains various articles relative on how to customize …","ref":"/docs/customizing/","tags":"","title":"Customizing"},{"body":"Elemental during installation, reset and upgrade (elemental install, elemental reset and elemental upgrade respectively) will read a configuration file in order to apply derivative customizations.

An image specification is defined by:\nfs: defines the filesystem of the image. Currently only ext2 and squashfs should be used for images and squashfs is only supported for the recovery-system image. label: defines the filesystem label. It is strongly recommended to use default labels as it is easy to fall into inconsistent states when changing labels as all changes should also be reflected in several other parts such as the bootloader configuration. This attribute has no effect for squashfs filesystems. uri: defines the source of the image. The uri must include a valid scheme to identify the type of source. It supports docker, channel, dir and file schemes. size: defines the filesystem image size in MiB, it must be big enough to store the defined image source. This attribute has no effect for squashfs filesystems. The partitions object lists partition specifications. A partition specifications is defined by:\nfs: defines the filesystem of the partition. Currently only ext2, ext4 and xfs are supported being ext4 the default. label: defines the label of the filesystem of the partition. It is strongly recommended to use default labels as it is easy to fall into inconsistent states when changing labels as all changes should also be reflected in several other parts such as the bootloader configuration. size: defines the partition size in MiB. A zero size means use all available disk, obviously this only makes sense for the last partition, the persistent partition. flags: is a list of strings, this is used as additional partition flags that are passed to parted (e.g. boot flag). Defaults should be just fine for most of the cases. The repositories object lists repositories metadata. Each repository can be defined by:\nname: name of the repository. priority: of the repository, being 1 the highest priority. uri: the URI of the repository. type: type of the repository, currently docker, disk or http. arch: the architecture this repository is for. reference: the Luet repository reference of this repository.

From an elemental perspective SELinux is some custom configurationt that requires special treatment. Being specific it mostly nails down to apply SELinux labels at install and upgrade time. Since the rootfs is readonly they can’t be easily applied at runtime or at boot time. As consequence of that SELinux autorelabel service should not be used within elemental as it expects a RW root and persistency across reboots (it essentially reboots after appliying labels). For the time being Elemental only considers the targeted SELinux policy.\nelemental-cli utility applies SELinux contexts to the installed/upgraded system if three conditions are met:\nthe installed system includes the setfiles command the installed system includes the targeted files context (/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts file) the binary for targeted policy is also present (/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.* file) In an Elemental workflow SElinux context labels should be applied at install/upgrade time for the readonly areas, but this is not enough as it doesn’t cover the ephemeral filesystems (overlayfs on top of tmpfs), which are usually sensitive paths like /etc/, /var, /srv, etc. In order to properly apply file contexts over the ephemeral paths the relabelling has to happen at boot time once those overlayfs are created. The appropriate stage for that is in initrd before switching root. In fact, it can be done as a cloud-init step as part of the initramfs stage, as it happens in cloud-config/selinux Luet package. The package provides 10_selinux.yaml with:\n# Default cOS OEM configuration file # Default cOS OEM configuration file # # This file is part of cOS and will get reset during upgrades. # # Before you change this file manually, # consider copying this file to /usr/local/cloud-config or # copy the file with a prefix starting by 90, e.g. /oem/91_custom.yaml name: \"SELinux\" stages: initramfs: - name: \"Relabelling\" commands: - | load_policy -i restorecon -R -i -v /etc /root /opt /srv /var /home /usr/local /oem Complete source code: https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit/blob/main/packages/cloud-config/oem/10_selinux.yaml Note it is required to load the policy in advance to be capable to apply the restorecon command. The restorecon command should be applied to all ephemeral paths and, depending on the specific use case, to the persistent paths too. Note that without restoring context on the ephemeral /etc it is unlikely the system is capable of properly booting, hence this is a very important step if SELinux is intended to used.\nUsing custom SELinux modules Making use of cloud-config/selinux and including SELinux utilities and targeted policy within the base OS it is enough to get started with SELinux, however there is a great chance that this is too generic and requires some additional policy modules to be fully functional according to each specific use case. In that regard the system/elemental-selinux luet package provides a basic custom module for illustration purposes, it should NOT be used as is in production. system/elemental-selinux provides the sources of a very simple Type Enforcement (TE) file (/usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.te) and the compiled Policy Package (/usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp) out of the TE file, ready to be installed and loaded by SELinux.\nThe Type Enforcement file was created by booting an Elemental OS on permissive mode using audit2allow and other SELinux related utilities to generate the custom module out of the reported denials. Something like:\n# Create the type enforcement file cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m elemental \u003e elemental.te # Create the policy module checkmodule -M -m -o elemental.mod elemental.te # Create the policy package out of the module semodule_package -o elemental.pp -m elemental.mod To make effective the policy package it has to be loaded or installed within the selinux policy, this can be easily done with the semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp command. So from a derivative perspective and following the example from Creating bootable image section adding the following lines to the Dockerfile should be enough to enable SELinux in enforcing mode:\n# Install the custom policy package if any and the restore context stage in cloud-init config RUN luet install -y system/elemental-selinux cloud-config/selinux # Load the policy package RUN semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp # Enable selinux in enforcing mode RUN sed -i \"s|^SELINUX=.*|SELINUX=enforcing|g\" /etc/selinux/config The above assumes the base image already includes the SELinux packages and utilities provided by the underlaying distro. It is suggested to set the enforcing mode via the config file rather than setting grub with the selinux kernel parameter (enforcing=1), this way it is easier, at any time, to temporarily add enforcing=0 at runtime within the grub2 shell and temporarily set SELinux in permissive mode.\nNotes when using a SELinux version prior to v3.4. If libsemanage version is lower than v3.4, it is likely that the semodule -i *.pp command fails with a cross-device linking issue, this is a known issue upstream and already fixed since v3.4. Command selinux -i \u003cfile\u003e mutates files under /var/lib/selinux/targeted and used to rename some files, this can be tricky when executed inside a container as hardlinks across filesystems are not permitted and this is actually what happens if the overlayfs driver is used. This can be worked around if all the originally mutated files are already modified within the execution layer (so they are part of the upper layer of the overlayfs). So the above specific example could be rewritten as:\n# Install the custom policy package if any and the restore context stage in cloud-init config RUN luet install -y system/elemental-selinux cloud-config/selinux # Artificially modify selinux files to copy them in within the overlyfs and then load the policy package RUN mv /var/lib/selinux/targeted/active /var/lib/selinux/targeted/previous \u0026\u0026\\ cp --link --recursive /var/lib/selinux/targeted/previous /var/lib/selinux/targeted/active \u0026\u0026\\ semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp # Enable selinux in enforcing mode RUN sed -i \"s|^SELINUX=.*|SELINUX=enforcing|g\" /etc/selinux/config ","categories":"","description":"SELinux support in Elemental\n","excerpt":"SELinux support in Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/customizing/selinux_support/","tags":"","title":"SELinux Support"},{"body":"Requirements:\nqemu-img utility elemental binary elemental runtime dependencies The suggested approach is based on using the Elemental installer (elemental install command) to run the installation from a Linux to a loop device.

We have an ‘active’ and a ‘passive’ system too boot from in case of failures a Recovery system which allows to perform emergency tasks in case of failure of the ‘A/B’ partitions a Fallback mechanism that boots the partitions in this sequence: “A -\u003e B -\u003e Recovery” in case of booting failures The upgrade happens in a transition image and take places only after all the necessary steps are completed. An upgrade of the ‘A/B’ partitions can be done by booting into them and running elemental upgrade. This will create a new pristine image that will be selected as active for the next reboot, the old one will be flagged as passive. If we are performing the same from the passive system, only the active is subject to changes.\nSimilarly, a recovery system can be upgraded as well by running elemental upgrade --recovery. This will upgrade the recovery system instead of the active/passive. Note both commands needs to be run inside the active or passive system.\nPartitions The default partitioning is created during installation and is expected to be present in a booted Elemental system:\na COS_STATE partition that will contain our active, passive and recovery images. The images are located under the /cOS directory a COS_PERSISTENT partition which contains the persistent user data. This directory is mounted over /usr/local during runtime a COS_OEM partition which contains the cloud-init oem files, which is mounted over /oem during runtime a COS_RECOVERY partition which contains the recovery system image The COS_STATE partitions contains the active, passive . While the active and passive are .img files which are loopback mounted, the recovery system is in COS_RECOVERY and can also be a squashfs file (provided in /cOS/recovery.squashfs). This ensures the immutability aspect and ease out building derivative in constrained environments (e.g. when we have restricted permissions and we can’t mount).\nFor more information about the immutability aspect of Elemental, see Immutable rootfs\n","categories":"","description":"Runtime layout of a booted Elemental derivative\n","excerpt":"Runtime layout of a booted Elemental derivative\n","ref":"/docs/reference/layout/","tags":"","title":"Runtime layout"},{"body":"\nRequirements:\nPacker AWS access keys with the appropriate roles and permissions A Vanilla AMI Packer templates The suggested approach is based on using Packer templates to customize the deployment and automate the upload and publish to AWS of Elemental derivatives or Elemental itself.

Vagrant To build vagrant images, we enable the vagrant feature, which allows the vagrant user to login afterwards:\n# From the root of a Elemental-toolkit repository checkout \u003e cd packer \u003e packer build -var \"iso=/path/to/image.iso\" -var \"feature=vagrant\" -only virtualbox-iso.cos . Customize the build with a variables file The packer template can be customized with the variables defined in packer/variables.pkr.hcl. These are the variables that can be set on run time using the -var key=value or -var-file=path flags. The variable file can be a json file including desired varibles. Consider the following example:\n# From the packer folder of the Elemental-toolkit repository checkout \u003e cat \u003c\u003c EOF \u003e test.json { \"root_username\": \"root\", \"root_password\": \"cos\" } EOF \u003e packer build -only qemu.cos -var \"iso=/path/to/image.iso\" -var-file=test.json . The above example runs the build by logging with a different username/password to run the installation.\nDefault cloud-init In the packer folder there is present a config.yaml file which can be used to customize the image. The file is in cloud-init style and will be automatically installed by default when running elemental install.\nAvailable variables for customization All the customizable variables are listed in packer/variables.pkr.hcl, these are some of the relevant ones:\nbuild,flavor,arch: This to personalize the artifact output name. The artifact output format is \"cOS_${var.flavor}_${var.build}_${var.arch}.tar.gz\"\ndisk_size: This sets the disk size to be used for the image.

That would allow us to transform that RAW image in a valid Azure/Google/Amazon Cloud blob that can be transformed into a VM image ready to be launched.\nThis generates a vanilla image that boots into recovery mode and can be used to deploy whatever image you want to the VM. Then you can snapshot that VM into a VM image ready to deploy with the default Elemental system or your derivative.\nThe RAW image can then be used into packer templates to generate custom Images, or used as-is with a userdata to deploy a container image of choice with an input user-data.\nGetting the packages By default, elemental will use the elemental-toolkit repo to obtain the required packages to build the raw image.\nWe can also use locally built packages instead. Just run:\nsudo make build sudo make create-repo All the artifacts will be generated under the build directory and a local repo will be created.\nThen prepare a manifest.yaml file with the local repo, so build-disk can read from it:\nraw_image: x86_64: # arch we are building for repositories: # list of repositories to use for getting the needed packages - uri: /home/user/elemental-toolkit/packages/ type: local As long as elemental is launched from the directory where the manifest.yaml file is, it will pick up that local repo and use the local packages to build the raw image.\nNote that you can do the same to override the default remote repository, in order to use your own remote repository:\nraw_image: x86_64: # arch we are building for repositories: # list of repositories to use for getting the needed packages - uri: https://my.custom.repo Building the RAW image The RAW image is just a RAW disk image that contains the recovery, so once launched is ready to be used for installing whatever Elemental or derivative that you want into the VM disks. This allows us to have a barebones base image that can be used for provisioning whatever Elemental you want.\nBuilding the RAW image is as simple as running:\nsudo elemental build-disk This will output a disk.raw file in the current directory which can be run with qemu, see booting.\nAWS No other steps are required, the raw disk can be already booted as an AMI image, see booting.\nAzure Requirements:\nAzure Cloud access keys with the appropriate roles and permissions azure-cli Transform the RAW image into a compatible Azure Cloud blob Currently importing images from storage blobs on Azure Cloud have a few requirements:\nonly fixed VHD format is supported VHD disk must have a virtual size aligned to 1 MB LVM is not supported no swap partition Elemental provides a --type flag that can be used to output an azure image directly:\nsudo elemental build-disk -t azure This will create a disk.raw.vhd which is our final artifact\nElemental also provides a convert command that can turn a previously created RAW image into an azure image:\nelemental convert-disk -t azure --keep-source disk.raw Uploading to Azure Cloud storage and importing it as an image The last step is to upload the blob to Azure Cloud storage and import that blob as a valid image.\nWith azure-cli installed and its credentials configured, you upload the blob with:\naz storage copy --source \u003ccos-azure-image\u003e --destination https://\u003caccount\u003e.blob.core.windows.net/\u003ccontainer\u003e/\u003cdestination-cos-azure-image\u003e And import it as an image with:\naz image create --resource-group \u003cresource-group\u003e --source https://\u003caccount\u003e.blob.core.windows.net/\u003ccontainer\u003e/\u003ccos-azure-image\u003e --os-type linux --hyper-v-generation v2 --name \u003cimage-name\u003e Where cos-azure-image is the blob we just uploaded, basically you can use the same value as you set in --destionation for the upload\nNote that we used --os-type linux --hyper-v-generation v2 as flags. This indicates that the image will be booted with UEFI and its required. Otherwise, launching the image will try to boot it in legacy mode, and it will fail.\nOnce this is over you will have you Elemental (or derivative) vanilla image ready for consumption. You can see your new image by running:\naz image show --resource-group \u003cresource-group\u003e --name \u003cimage-name\u003e Google cloud Requirements:\nGoogle Cloud access keys with the appropriate roles and permissions gsutil and gcloud tools Transform the RAW image into a compatible Google Cloud blob Currently importing images from storage blobs on Google Cloud have a few requirements:\nblobs have to be tar.gzipped with the flag --format=oldgnu the disk.raw has to be rounded up to the next Gb ( so no 2.1gb images or 2.4, they need to be an exact 3Gb or 2Gb) image inside the tar.gzip blob needs to be called disk.raw Elemental provides a --type flag that can be used to output a GCE image directly:\nsudo elemental build-disk -t gce This will create a disk.raw.tar.gz which is our final artifact\nElemental also provides a convert command that can turn a previously created RAW image into an azure image:\nelemental convert-disk -t gce --keep-source disk.raw Uploading to Google Cloud storage and importing it as an image The last step is to upload the blob to Google Cloud storage and import that blob as a valid image.\nWith gsutil and gcloud tools installed and their credentials configured, you upload the blob with:\ngsutil cp disk.raw.tar.gz gs://YOURBUCKET/ Where YOURBUCKET is the destination bucket you want your file to end up in.\nAnd import it as an image with:\ngcloud compute images create IMAGENAME --source-uri=SOURCEURI --guest-os-features=UEFI_COMPATIBLE Where:\nIMAGENAME: The name for the final image SOURCEURI: The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in .tar.gz. This is the full path to the blob we just uploaded. Note that we used --guest-os-features=UEFI_COMPATIBLE as a flag. This indicates that the image will be booted with UEFI and its required. Otherwise, launching the image will try to boot it in legacy mode and it will fail.\nOnce this is over you will have you Elemental (or derivative) vanilla image ready for consumption.

Everything under /system/oem will be loaded during the various stages (boot, network, initramfs). You can check here for the Elemental defaults.

COS grub configuration includes three menu entries: first for the main OS system, second for the fallback OS system and a third for the recovery OS.\nFor example the main OS system menu entry could be something like:\nmenuentry \"cOS\" --id cos { search.fs_label COS_STATE root set img=/cOS/active.img set label=COS_ACTIVE loopback loop0 /$img set root=($root) source (loop0)/etc/cos/bootargs.cfg linux (loop0)$kernel $kernelcmd initrd (loop0)$initramfs } Kernel parameters The kernel parameters are not part of the persistent grub.cfg file stored in COS_RECOVERY partition. Kernel parameters are sourced from the loop device of the OS image to boot. This is mainly to keep kernel parameters consistent across different potential OS images or system upgrades. Specifying default custom boot options Elemental images and its derivatives, are expected to include a /etc/cos/bootargs.cfg file which provides the definition of the following variables:\n$kernel: Path of the kernel binary $kernelcmd: Kernel parameters $initramfs: Path of the initrd binary This is the mechanism any Elemental image or Elemental derivative has to communicate its boot parameters (kernel, kernel params and initrd file) to GRUB2.\nFor example, the default Elemental bootarg.cfg file is:\nset kernel=/boot/vmlinuz if [ -n \"$recoverylabel\" ]; then # Boot arguments when the image is used as recovery set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=live:CDLABEL=$recoverylabel rd.live.dir=/ rd.live.squashimg=$img panic=5\" else # Boot arguments when the image is used as active/passive set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=LABEL=$label iso-scan/filename=$img panic=5 security=selinux rd.cos.oemlabel=COS_OEM selinux=1\" fi set initramfs=/boot/initrd You can tweak that file to suit your needs if you need to specify persistent boot arguments.\nNote rd.cos.oemlabel=COS_OEM is required inside the bootargs in order to access to the /oem mount within the rootfs stage. COS_OEM is the default label for the oem partition. Grub environment variables Elemental (since v0.5.8) makes use of the GRUB2 environment block which can used to define persistent GRUB2 variables across reboots.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define the desired values.\nVariable Description next_entry Set the next reboot entry saved_entry Set the default boot entry default_menu_entry Set the name entries on the GRUB menu extra_active_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into active extra_passive_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into passive extra_recovery_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into recovery extra_cmdline Set additional boot commands for all entries default_fallback Sets default fallback logic For instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Note The examples below make of the COS_OEM device, however it could use any device detected by GRUB2 that includes the file /grubenv. First match wins. Default boot entry The default grub configuration loads the /grubenv of any available device and evaluates on next_entry variable and saved_entry variable. By default none is set.\nThe default boot entry is set to the value of saved_entry, in case the variable is not set grub just defaults to the first menu entry.\nnext_entry variable can be used to overwrite the default boot entry for a single boot. If next_entry variable is set this is only being used once, GRUB2 will unset it after reading it for the first time. This is helpful to define the menu entry to reboot to without having to make any permanent config change.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define desired values.\nFor instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Or to set the default entry to fallback system:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set saved_entry=fallback Boot menu By default Elemental and derivatives shows the default boot menu entry while booting (Elemental).\nThe grub menu entry is generated during installation and can be configured by setting GRUB_ENTRY_NAME in the /etc/os-release file inside the derivative, or either via the general configuration to specify installation details.\nFor example, specifying in /etc/elemental/config.yaml:\ninstall: ... grub-entry-name: myOS ... will automatically set the GRUB menu entries for active, passive and recovery to the specified value.\nThe grub menu boot entry can also be set with grub2-editenv:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default_menu_entry=fooOS Additional menu entries Since\nsystem/grub2-config = 0.0.14 it is possible to add multiple custom menu entries to GRUB by creating a /grubmenu config file in one of the available partitions detected by GRUB2 during boot. The file will be loaded from the first partition found by GRUB that have the grubmenu file. First match wins. The grubmenu file will be sourced at the end of the boot process, and can contain several menuentry blocks.\nPersistent boot option flags It is possible to define persistent boot flag for each menu entry also via grub2-editenv:\nextra_active_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on active boot extra_passive_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on passive boot extra_recovery_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on recovery extra_cmdline: will be applied to each boot entry Customizing fallback logic By default Elemental boots into active, and if there are failures will boot into the passive, and finally if keeps failing, will boot into recovery.\nIt is possible to override the default fallback logic by setting default_fallback as grub environment, consider for example:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default_fallback=\"2 0 1\" Will set the default fallback to “2 0 1” instead of the default “0 1 2”.\n","categories":"","description":"GRUB 2 Configuration\n","excerpt":"GRUB 2 Configuration\n","ref":"/docs/customizing/configure_grub/","tags":"","title":"GRUB"},{"body":"The immutable rootfs concept in Elemental is provided by a dracut module which is basically the contents of the immutable-rootfs package provided as part of the Elemental repository tree.\nBy default, cos and derivatives will inherit an immutable setup.\nA running system will look like as follows:\n/usr/local - persistent (COS_PERSISTENT) /oem - persistent (COS_OEM) /etc - ephemeral /usr - read only / immutable This means that any changes that are not specified as cloud-init configuration are not persisting across reboots.\nYou can place persisting cloud-init files either in /oem or /usr/local/oem, Elemental already supports cloud-init datasources, so you can use also load cloud-init configuration as standard userdata, depending on the platform.

It will pull a new container image during this phase, which will be booted on the next reboot.\nUpgrade to a specific container image To specify a specific container image to upgrade to instead of the regular upgrade channels, run elemental upgrade --system.uri imagei-uri.\nNote by default elemental upgrade --system.uri runs an mtree checksum verificatiom (requires images manifests generated with mtree separately). To disable image checksum verification, run elemental upgrade --verify --system.uri.\nIntegration with System Upgrade Controller If running a kubernetes cluster on the Elemental system, you can leverage the system-upgrade-controller to trigger upgrades to specific image versions, for example:\n--- apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind: Plan metadata: name: elemental-upgrade namespace: system-upgrade labels: k3s-upgrade: server spec: concurrency: 1 version: fleet-sample # Image tag nodeSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: k3s.io/hostname, operator: Exists} serviceAccountName: system-upgrade cordon: true # drain: # force: true upgrade: image: quay.io/costoolkit/test-images # Image upgrade reference command: - \"/usr/sbin/suc-upgrade\" See also trigger upgrades with fleet\nFrom ISO The ISO can be also used as a recovery medium: type elemental upgrade from a LiveCD. It will then try to upgrade the image of the active partition installed in the system.\nHow it works Elemental during installation sets two .img images files in the COS_STATE partition:\n/cOS/active.img labeled COS_ACTIVE: Where Elemental typically boots from /cOS/passive.img labeled COS_PASSIVE: Where Elemental boots for fallback Those are used by the upgrade mechanism to prepare and install a pristine Elemental each time an upgrade is attempted.\n","categories":"","description":"How to run upgrades in Elemental\n","excerpt":"How to run upgrades in Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/getting-started/upgrading/","tags":"","title":"Upgrading"},{"body":" Section under construction.\nWhile building a derivative, or on a running system things can go really wrong, the guide is aimed to give tips while building derivatives and also debugging running systems.\nDon’t forget tocheck the known issues for the release you’re using.\nBefore booting, several kernel parameters can be used to help during debugging (also when booting an ISO). Those are meant to be used only while debugging, and they might defeat the concept of immutability.\nDisable Immutability By adding rd.cos.debugrw to the boot parameters read only mode will be disabled.

The recovery image can’t be mutated.\nNote The changes made will persist during reboots but won’t persist across upgrades. If you need to persist changes across upgrades in runtime (for example by adding additional packages on top of the derivative image), see how to apply persistent changes. Debug initramfs issues As derivative can ship and build their own initrd, the official debug docs contains valid information that can be used for troubleshooting.\nFor example:\nrd.break=pre-mount rd.shell: Drop a shell before setting up mount points rd.break=pre-pivot rd.shell: Drop a shell before switch-root Recovery partition If you can boot into the system, the recovery partition can be used to reset the state of the active/passive, but can also be used to upgrade to specific images. Be sure to read the Recovery section in the docs.\nMutating derivative images It can be useful to mutate derivative images and commit a container’s file changes or settings into a new image. This allows you to debug a container by running an interactive shell, and re-use the mutated image in Elemental systems. Generally, it is better to use Dockerfiles to manage your images in a documented and maintainable way. Read more about creating bootable images.\nLet’s suppose we have the derivative original image at $IMAGE and we want to mutate it.

Upgrades delivered with container registry images ( also workflow with docker run \u0026\u0026 docker commit supported! ) The content of the container image is the system which is booted. High level overview elemental-toolkit encompasses several components required for building and distributing OS images. This issue summarize the current state, and how we plan to integrate them in a single CLI to improve the user experience.\nelemental-toolkit is also a manifest, which includes package definitions of how the underlying OS is composed. It forms an abstraction layer, which is then translated to Dockerfiles and built by our CI (optionally) for re-usal. A derivative can be built by parts of the manifest, or reusing it entirely, container images included.\nThe fundamental phases can be summarized in the following steps:\nBuild packages from container images (and optionally keep build caches) Extract artefacts from containers Add metadata(s) and create a repository (optionally) publish the repository and the artefacts The developer of the derivative applies a customization layer during build, which is an augmentation layer in the same form of elemental-toolkit itself.\nDistribution The OS delivery mechanism is done via container registries. The developer that wants to provide upgrades for the custom OS will push the resulting container images to the container registry. It will then be used by the installed system to pull upgrades from.\nUpgrade mechanism There are two different upgrade mechanisms available that can be used from a maintainer perspective: (a) release channels or (b) providing a container image reference ( e.g. my.registry.com/image:tag ) that can be tweaked in the customization phases to achieve the desired effect.\n","categories":"","description":"High level architecture of Elemental and its components.\n","excerpt":"High level architecture of Elemental and its components.\n","ref":"/docs/reference/high_level_architecture/","tags":"","title":"High level architecture"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Elemental tutorials and real life use-case samples\n","excerpt":"Elemental tutorials and real life use-case samples\n","ref":"/docs/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":" Github project for our sprint board Samples repositories Build a derivative and upgrade it with fleet ","categories":"","description":"References for Elemental derivatives, like common featuresets, high level architecture\n","excerpt":"References for Elemental derivatives, like common featuresets, high …","ref":"/docs/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":" For Vagrant Boxes, OVA and QEMU images at the moment we are relying on packer templates.\nThe Elemental vanilla images can be used as input to Packer to deploy pristine images of the user container image with elemental reset.\n","categories":"","description":"Building VBox, OVA, QEMU, etc. images of your derivative with Packer\n","excerpt":"Building VBox, OVA, QEMU, etc. images of your derivative with Packer\n","ref":"/docs/creating-derivatives/packer/","tags":"","title":"Building images with Packer"},{"body":"Welcome!\nThe Elemental (containerized OS) distribution is entirely built over GitHub.

Tweak or set the Makefile’s REPO_CACHE and FINAL_REPO accordingly. Those are used respectively for an image used for cache, and for the final image reference. Those are not required for building - you can disable image push (--push) from the Makefile or just by specifying e.g. BUILD_ARGS=--pull when calling the make targets.\nBuilding locally Elemental has a container image which can be used to build Elemental locally in order to generate the Elemental packages and the Elemental iso from your checkout.\nFrom your git folder:\n$\u003e docker build -t cos-builder . $\u003e docker run --privileged=true -e FINAL_REPO=YOUR_REPO --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD:/build cos-builder Where FINAL_REPO is the repository where you artifacts reside or will reside. The builder uses that repo to diff the existing packages in that repository versus the packages to build, so it can only build missing packages instead of building the whole repo. Pointing it to an empty or nonexistent address will build all packages.\nBuild all packages locally Building locally has a set of dependencies that should be satisfied.\nThen you can run\n# make build as root\nTo clean from previous runs, run make clean.\nNote: The makefile uses yq and jq to retrieve the packages to build from the iso specfile.\nIf you don’t have jq and yq installed, you must pass by the packages manually with PACKAGES (e.g. PACKAGES=\"system/cos live/systemd-boot live/boot live/syslinux\").\nYou might want to build packages running as root or sudo -E if you intend to preserve file permissions in the resulting packages (mainly for xattrs, and so on).\nBuild ISO If using SLES or openSUSE, first install the required deps:\n# zypper in -y squashfs xorriso dosfstools and then, simply run\n# make local-iso Testing ISO changes To test changes against a specific set of packages, you can for example:\n# make PACKAGES=\"toolchain/yq\" build local-iso root is required because we want to keep permissions on the output packages (not really required for experimenting).\nRun with qemu After you have the iso locally, run\n$\u003e QEMU=qemu-system-x86_64 make run-qemu This will create a disk image at .qemu/drive.img and boot from the ISO.\nIf the image already exists, it will NOT be overwritten.\nYou need to run an explicit make clean_run to wipe the image and start over.\nInstalling With a fresh drive.img, make run-qemu will boot from ISO.

Elemental allows to create custom OS versions in your cluster with standard container images with a high degree of customization. It can also be used in its vanilla form - Elemental enables then everyone to build their own derivative and access it in various formats.\nBuilding a bootable image is as simple as running docker build.\nWhat is it good for?: Embedded, Cloud, Containers, VM, Baremetals, Servers, IoT, Edge Design goals A Manifest for container-based OS.

A/B updates Easy to customize Cryptographically verified Instant switch from different versions Recovery mechanism with Elemental vanilla images (or bring your own) Mission The elemental-toolkit project is under the Elemental umbrella.\nElemental-toolkit provides a unique container based approach to define the system lifecycle of an immutable Linux derivative, without any string attached to a specific Linux distribution.\nAt its heart, Elemental-toolkit is the abstraction layer between Linux distro management and the specific purpose of the OS.\nElemental-toolkit empowers anyone to create derivatives from standard OCI images. Frees whoever wants to create a Linux derivative from handling the heavy bits of packaging and managing entire repositories to propagate upgrades, simplifying the entire process by using container images as base for OS. At the same time, Elemental-toolkit provides an highly integrated ecosystem which is designed to be container-first, cloud native, and immutable. Anyone can tweak Elemental-toolkit derivatives from the bottom-up to enable and disable its featureset.\nAs the Elemental team, the elemental project is our point of reference.\nElemental is a complete derivative built with elemental-toolkit tied with the rancher ecosystem and full cycle node management solution with Kubernetes.\nWe are supporting directly and indirectly elemental within changes also in the Elemental ecosystem.\nElemental is our main show-case, and as the Elemental team we are committed to it. It encompasses several technologies to create a Kubernetes-focused Linux derivative which lifecycle is managed entirely from Kubernetes itself, Secure Device Onboarding included, and automatic provisioning via cloud-init.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is Elemental toolkit?

The immutability concept refers to read only root (/) system. To ensure the linux OS is still functional certain paths or areas are required to be writable, in those cases an ephemeral overlay tmpfs is set in place. Additionally, the immutable rootfs module can also mount a custom list of device blocks with read write permissions, those are mostly devoted to store persistent data.\nThe dracut module is mostly configured via kernel command line parameters or via the /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment file.\nThese are the read write paths the module mounts as part of the overlay ephemeral tmpfs: /etc, /root, /home, /opt, /srv, /usr/local and /var.\nThese paths will be all ephemeral unless there is a block device configured to be mounted in the same path.\nIt is important to remark all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nKernel configuration parameters The immutable rootfs can be configured with the following kernel parameters:\ncos-img/filename=\u003cimgfile\u003e: This is one of the main parameters, it defines the location of the image file to boot from.\nrd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:\u003csize\u003e: This defines the size of the tmpfs used for the ephemeral overlayfs. It can be expressed in MiB or as a % of the available memory. Defaults to rd.cos.overlay=tmpfs:20% if not present.\nrd.cos.overlay=LABEL=\u003cvol_label\u003e: Optionally and mostly for debugging purposes the overlayfs can be mounted on top of a persistent block device. Block devices can be expressed by LABEL (LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e) or by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e)\nrd.cos.mount=LABEL:\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This option defines a persistent block device and its mountpoint. Block devices can also be defined by UUID (UUID=\u003cblk_uuid\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e). This option can be passed multiple times.\nrd.cos.oemtimeout=\u003cseconds\u003e: cOS by default assumes the existence of a persistent block device labelled COS_OEM which is used to keep some configuration data (mostly cloud-init files). The immutable rootfs tries to mount this device at very early stages of the boot even before applying the immutable rootfs configs. It’s done this way to enable to configure the immutable rootfs module within the cloud-init files. As the COS_OEM device might not be always present the boot process just continues without failing after a certain timeout. This option configures such a timeout. Defaults to 10s.\nrd.cos.debugrw: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. This option sets the root image to be mounted as a writable device. Note this completely breaks the concept of an immutable root. This is helpful for debugging or testing purposes, so changes persist across reboots.\nrd.cos.disable: This is a boolean option, true if present, false if not. It disables the execution of any immutable rootfs module logic at boot.\nConfiguration with an environment file The immutable rootfs can be configured with the /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment file. It is important to note that all the immutable root configuration is applied in initrd before switching root and after rootfs cloud-init stage but before initramfs stage. So immutable rootfs configuration via cloud-init using the /run/cos/cos-layout.env file is only effective if called in any of the rootfs.before, rootfs or rootfs.after cloud-init stages.\nIn the environment file the following options are available:\nVOLUMES=LABEL=\u003cblk_label\u003e:\u003cmountpoint\u003e: This variable expects a block device and it mountpoint pair space separated list. The default cOS configuration is:\nVOLUMES=\"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\"\nOVERLAY: It defines the underlaying device for the overlayfs as in rd.cos.overlay= kernel parameter.\nDEBUGRW=true: Sets the root (/) to be mounted with read/write permissions.\nMERGE=true: Sets makes the VOLUMES values to be merged with any other volume that might have been defined in the kernel command line. The merging criteria is simple: any overlapping volume is overwritten all others are appended to whatever was already defined as a kernel parameter. If not defined defaults to true.\nRW_PATHS: This is a space separated list of paths. These are the paths that will be used for the ephemeral overlayfs. These are the paths that will be mounted as overlay on top of the OVERLAY (or rd.cos.overlay) device. Default value is:\nRW_PATHS=\"/etc /root /home /opt /srv /usr/local /var\" Note: as those paths are overlayed with an ephemeral mount (tmpfs), additional data wrote on those location won’t be available on subsequent boots.\nPERSISTENT_STATE_TARGET: This is the folder where the persistent state data will be stored, if any. Default value is /usr/local/.state.\nPERSISTENT_STATE_PATHS: This is a space separated list of paths. These are the paths that will become writable and store its data inside PERSISTENT_STATE_TARGET. By default this variable is empty, which means no persistent state area is created or used.\nNote: The specified paths needs to either exist or be located in an area which is writeable ( for example, inside locations specified with RW_PATHS). The dracut module will attempt to create nonexistent directories, but might fail if the mountpoint where they are located is read-only.\nPERSISTENT_STATE_BIND=\"true|false\": When this variable is set to true the persistent state paths are bind mounted (instead of using overlayfs) after being mirrored with the original content. By default this variable is set to false.\nNote that persistent state is setup once the ephemeral paths and persistent volumes are mounted. Persistent state paths can’t be an already existing mount point. If the persistent state requires any of the paths that are part of the ephemeral area by default, then RW_PATHS needs to be defined to avoid overlapping paths.\nFor example a common cOS configuration can be expressed as part of the cloud-init configuration as follows:\nname: example stage: rootfs: - name: \"Layout configuration\" environment_file: /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment: VOLUMES: \"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\" OVERLAY: \"tmpfs:25%\" ","categories":"","description":"Documentation for the system/immutable-rootfs package\n","excerpt":"Documentation for the system/immutable-rootfs package\n","ref":"/docs/reference/packages/system-immutable-rootfs/","tags":"","title":"system/immutable-rootfs"},{"body":" Note utils/installer is part of the cOS toolkit repository and can be installed with:\nluet install -y utils/installer in the derivative’s Dockerfile.\nThis package provides the following utilities:\ncos-installer ( wrapper of cos --install ) cos-deploy ( wrapper of elemental install ) cos-reset ( wrapper of elemental reset ) cos-rebrand ( wrapper of cos --rebrand ) cos-upgrade ( wrapper of elemental upgrade ) suc-upgrade ( wrapper of cos --upgrade ) ","categories":"","description":"Documentation for the utils/installer package\n","excerpt":"Documentation for the utils/installer package\n","ref":"/docs/reference/packages/utils-installer/","tags":"","title":"utils/installer"},{"body":" Note system/kernel is part of the cOS toolkit repository and can be installed with:\nluet install -y system/kernel in the derivative’s Dockerfile.\nThis package provides the default distribution kernel which should be suitable for generic machines.\nIn cases where Derivative wish to re-use the same initrd and kernel from cOS vanilla images, this package can be used in conjuction with system/dracut-initrd.\n","categories":"","description":"Documentation for the system/kernel package\n","excerpt":"Documentation for the system/kernel package\n","ref":"/docs/reference/packages/system-kernel/","tags":"","title":"system/kernel"},{"body":" Note meta/toolchain is part of the cOS toolkit repository and can be installed with:\nluet install -y meta/toolchain in the derivative’s Dockerfile.\nA meta package for luet and elemental-cli.\n","categories":"","description":"Documentation for the meta/toolchain package\n","excerpt":"Documentation for the meta/toolchain package\n","ref":"/docs/reference/packages/meta-packages/meta-toolchain/","tags":"","title":"meta/toolchain"},{"body":" Immutable Linux Derivatives at your fingertips Elemental is a toolkit to build, ship and maintain cloud-init driven Linux derivatives with containers..
