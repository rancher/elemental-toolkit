Several default cloud config are present in the Elemental repositories. They can be all pulled with the `system/cloud-config` package or individually ( `cloud-config/<package>` ).

Each one of them bring a separate functionality or extend the system. For example, the `networking` cloud-config provides a basic networking setting, or `cloud-config/rootfs` provides a basic cOS default rootfs layout configuration.
