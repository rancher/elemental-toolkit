All the available cloud-init keywords can be used in each stage. Additionally, it’s possible also to hook before or after a stage has run, each one has a specific stage which is possible to run steps: boot.after, network.before, fs.after etc.\nMultiple stages can be specified in a single cloud-init file.\nNote When a Elemental derivative boots it creates sentinel files in order to allow to execute cloud-init steps programmaticaly.\n/run/cos/recovery_mode is being created when booting from the recovery partition /run/cos/live_mode is created when booting from the LiveCD To execute a block using the sentinel files you can specify: if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/...\" ]', see the examples below.\nStages Below there is a detailed list of the stages available that can be used in the cloud-init configuration files\nrootfs This is the earliest stage, running before switching root, just right after the root is mounted in /sysroot and before applying the immutable rootfs configuration. This stage is executed over initrd root, no chroot is applied.\nExample:\nname: \"Set persistent devices\" stage: rootfs: - name: \"Layout configuration\" environment_file: /run/cos/cos-layout.env environment: VOLUMES: \"LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local\" OVERLAY: \"tmpfs:25%\" initramfs This is still an early stage, running before switching root. Here you can apply radical changes to the booting setup of Elemental. Despite this is executed before switching root this exection runs chrooted into the target root after the immutable rootfs is set up and ready.\nExample:\nname: \"Run something on initramfs\" stages: initramfs: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in active or passive touch /etc/something_important - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode boot This stage is executed after initramfs has switched root, during the systemd bootup process.\nExample:\nname: \"Run something on boot\" stages: boot: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in active or passive - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode fs This stage is executed when fs is mounted and is guaranteed to have access to COS_STATE and COS_PERSISTENT.\nExample:\nname: \"Run something on boot\" stages: fs: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | touch /usr/local/something - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode network This stage is executed when network is available\nExample:\nname: \"Run something on boot\" stages: network: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Network is available, do something.. reconcile This stage is executed 5m after boot and periodically each 60m.\nExample:\nname: \"Run something on boot\" stages: reconcile: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/sentinel\" ]' commands: - | touch /run/sentinel post-install This stage is executed after installation of the OS has ended (last step of elemental install).\nExample:\nname: \"Run something after installation\" stages: post-install: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in active or passive - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode after-install-chroot This stage is executed after installation of the OS filesystem image has completed. Note Steps executed at this stage are running inside the new OS as chroot, allowing to write persisting changes to the image, for example by installing additional software. Example:\nname: \"Run something after installation\" stages: after-install-chroot: - name: \"Setting\" commands: - | ... after-install This stage is executed after installation of the OS filesystem image has completed and just after the chroot hook. Note Steps executed at this stage are running when the new image and all the relevant partitions are still mounted in rw mode, allowing to write persisting changes to the image, for example installing additional software. Example:\nname: \"Run something after installation\" stages: after-install: - name: \"Setting\" commands: - | ... post-upgrade This stage is executed after upgrade of the OS has ended (last step of elemental upgrade).\nExample:\nname: \"Run something after upgrade\" stages: post-upgrade: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in active or passive - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode after-upgrade-chroot This stage is executed after installation of the OS filesystem image has completed. Note Steps executed at this stage are running inside the new OS as chroot, allowing to write persisting changes to the image, for example by downloading and installing additional software. Note Steps executed at this stage are based on stages found within the chroot, hence any new (not present in the current host) upgrade specific hook that requires to be executed during upgrade should be included here. Otherwise it will not be seen by elemental-cli during the upgrade. Example:\nname: \"Run something after upgrade\" stages: after-upgrade-chroot: - name: \"Setting\" commands: - | ... after-upgrade This stage is executed after installation of the OS filesystem image has completed and just after the chroot hook.\nExample:\nname: \"Run something after upgrade\" stages: after-upgrade: - name: \"Setting\" commands: - | ... post-reset This stage is executed after reset of the OS has ended (last step of elemental reset).\nExample:\nname: \"Run something after reset\" stages: post-reset: - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in active or passive - name: \"Setting\" if: '[ -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' commands: - | # Run something when we are booting in recovery mode after-reset-chroot This stage is executed after installation of the OS filesystem image has completed.

Elemental assets can be used to either drive unattended deployments of a derivative or used to create custom images (with packer).\nPhilosophy Philosophy behind elemental-toolkit is simple: it allows you to create Linux derivatives from container images.\nContainer registry as a single source of truth Hybrid way to access your image for different scopes (development, debugging, ..) No more inconsistent states between nodes. A “Store” to keep your (tagged) shared states where you can rollback and upgrade into. “Stateless”: Images with upgrades are rebuilt from scratch instead of applying upgrades. A/B upgrades, immutable systems The container image is booted as-is, encapsulating all the needed components (kernel, initrd included) and can be pulled locally for inspection, development and debugging. At the same time it can be used also to create installation medium as ISO, Raw images, OVA or Cloud specific images.\nA derivative automatically inherits the following featureset:\nCan upgrade to another container image Can deploy a system from scratch from an image Reset or recovery to a specific image Customize the image during runtime to persist changes across reboots Perform an installation from the LiveCD medium Building Elemental derivatives The starting point to use elemental-toolkit is to check out our examples and our creating bootable images section.\nThe only requirement to build derivatives with elemental-toolkit is Docker installed. If you are interested in building elemental-toolkit itself, see Development notes.\nThe toolkit itself is delivered as a set of standalone, re-usable OCI artifacts which are tagged and tracked as standard OCI images and it is installed inside the container image to provide the same featureset among derivatives, see how to create bootable images.\nVanilla images Elemental releases are composed of vanilla images that are used internally for testing and can be used as a starting point to deploy derivatives in specific environments (e.g. AWS) or just to try out the Elemental featureset.\nThe vanilla images ships no specific business-logic aside serving as a base for testing and deploying other derivatives.\nWhat to do next? Check out how to create bootable images or download the Elemental vanilla images to give Elemental a try!\nHere below you will find the common documentation that applies to any derivative built with Elemental and the Elemental vanilla images.\n","categories":"","description":"Getting started with Elemental\n","excerpt":"Getting started with Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":"\nA derivative is a simple container image which can be processed by the Elemental toolkit in order to be bootable and installable.

Those are the common set of packages between derivatives. See also package stack. By default the initrd is expected to be symlinked to /boot/initrd and the kernel to /boot/vmlinuz, otherwise you can specify a custom path while building an iso and by customizing grub.\nBuilding The workflow would be then:\ndocker build the image docker push the image to some registry elemental upgrade --docker-image $IMAGE from a Elemental machine or (elemental reset if bootstrapping a cloud image) The following can be incorporated in any standard gitops workflow.\nYou can explore more examples in the example section on how to create bootable images.\nWhat’s next?

That means that any change in the running OS will not persist after a reboot.\nWhile configurations can be persisted, there are occasions where installing a custom package or provide additional persistent files in the end system is needed.\nWe will see here a way to install packages, drivers, or apply any modification we might want to do in the OS image during runtime, without any need to rebuild the derivative container image. This will let any user (and not derivative developer) to apply any needed customization and to be able to persist across upgrades.\nTransient changes To apply transient changes, it’s possible to boot a Elemental derivative in read/write mode by specifying rd.cos.debugrw see here for more details. This allows to do any change and will persist into the active/passive booting system (does NOT apply for recovery). Altough this methodology should be only considered for debugging purposes.\nPersist changes with Cloud init files Elemental allows to apply a set of commands, or cloud-init steps, during upgrade, deploy, install and reset in the context of the target image, in RW capabilities. This allows to carry on changes during upgrades on the target image without the need to re-build or have a custom derivative image.\nAll the configuration that we want to apply to the system will run each time we do an upgrade, a reset or an installation on top of the new downloaded image (in case of upgrade) or the image which is the target system.\nBetween the available stages in the cloud-init there are after-upgrade-chroot, after-install-chroot, after-reset-chroot and after-deploy-chroot, for example, consider the following cloud-init file:\nstages: name: \"Install something\" stages: after-upgrade-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-reset-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-deploy-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... after-install-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y ... It will run the zypper in -y ... calls during each stage, in the context of the target system, allowing to customize the target image with additional packages.\nNote zypper calls here are just an example. We could have used dnf for fedora based, or apt-get for ubuntu based images. When running the cloud-init steps the /oem partition and /usr/local will be mounted to COS_OEM and COS_PERSISTENT respectively, allowing to load extra data (e.g. rpm files, or configuration).\nExample If an user wants to install an additional package in the running system, and keep having that persistent across upgrades, he can copy the following file (install.yaml) inside the /oem folder, or /usr/local/cloud-config:\nstages: name: \"Install something\" stages: after-upgrade-chroot: - commands: - zypper in -y vim and run elemental upgrade.\nIt will automatically upgrade the system with the changes above included.\n","categories":"","description":"Applying changes to Elemental images in runtime or “how to install a package in an immutable OS at runtime?”\n","excerpt":"Applying changes to Elemental images in runtime or “how to install a …","ref":"/docs/customizing/runtime_persistent_changes/","tags":"","title":"Runtime persistent changes"},{"body":"You can find the examples below in the examples folder.\nFrom standard images Besides using the elemental-toolkit toolchain, it’s possible to create standard container images which are consumable by the vanilla Elemental images (ISO, Cloud Images, etc.) during the upgrade and deploy phase.\nAn example of a Dockerfile image can be:\n# run `make build` to build local/elemental-toolkit image ARG TOOLKIT_REPO ARG VERSION FROM ${TOOLKIT_REPO}:${VERSION} AS TOOLKIT # OS base image of our choice FROM registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap:15.5 as OS ARG REPO ARG VERSION ENV VERSION=${VERSION} # install kernel, systemd, dracut, grub2 and other required tools RUN ARCH=$(uname -m); \\ [[ \"${ARCH}\" == \"aarch64\" ]] \u0026\u0026 ARCH=\"arm64\"; \\ zypper --non-interactive install --no-recommends -- \\ kernel-default \\ device-mapper \\ dracut \\ grub2 \\ grub2-${ARCH}-efi \\ shim \\ haveged \\ systemd \\ NetworkManager \\ openssh-server \\ openssh-clients \\ timezone \\ parted \\ e2fsprogs \\ dosfstools \\ mtools \\ xorriso \\ findutils \\ gptfdisk \\ rsync \\ squashfs \\ lvm2 \\ tar \\ gzip \\ vim \\ which \\ less \\ sudo \\ curl \\ iproute2 \\ sed # Just add the elemental cli COPY --from=TOOLKIT /usr/bin/elemental /usr/bin/elemental # Enable essential services RUN systemctl enable NetworkManager.service # Enable /tmp to be on tmpfs RUN cp /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system # Add default network configuration ADD 05_network.yaml /system/oem/05_network.yaml # Generate initrd with required elemental services RUN elemental init --debug --force # Update os-release file with some metadata RUN echo IMAGE_REPO=\\\"${REPO}\\\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release \u0026\u0026 \\ echo IMAGE_TAG=\\\"${VERSION}\\\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release \u0026\u0026 \\ echo IMAGE=\\\"${REPO}:${VERSION}\\\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release \u0026\u0026 \\ echo TIMESTAMP=\"`date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S'`\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release \u0026\u0026 \\ echo GRUB_ENTRY_NAME=\\\"Elemental\\\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release # Good for validation after the build CMD /bin/bash Complete source code: https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit/blob/main/examples/green/Dockerfile We can just run docker to build the image with\ndocker build -t $IMAGE .

It supports oci, dir and file schemes. size: defines the filesystem image size in MiB, it must be big enough to store the defined image source. This attribute has no effect for squashfs filesystems.

The config file reproduced here is meant to be included as a user-data in a cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure, etc) or as part of a cdrom (Elemental-Recovery will try to fetch /userdata file from a cdrom device).\nA vanilla image is an image that only provides the Elemental-Recovery system on a COS_RECOVERY partition. It does not include any other system and it is meant to be dumped to a bigger disk and deploy a Elemental system or a derivative system over the free space in disk. COS vanilla images are build as part of the CI workflow, see CI artifacts to download one of those.\nThe configuration file of this example has two purposes: first it deploys Elemental, second in reboots on the deployed OS and deploys K3S + Fleet + System Upgrades Controller.\nOn first boot it will fail to boot Elemental grub menu entry and fallback to Elemental-Recovery system. From there it will partition the vanilla image to create the main system partition (COS_STATE) and add an extra partition for persistent data (COS_PERSISTENT). It will use the full disk, a disk of at least 20GiB is recommended. After partitioning it will deploy the main system on COS_STATE and reboot to it.\nOn consequent boots it will simply boot from COS_STATE, there it prepares the persistent areas of the system (arranges few bind mounts inside COS_PERSISTENT) and then it runs an standard installation of K3s, Fleet and System Upgrade Controller. After few minutes after the system is up the K3s cluster is up and running.\nNote this setup similar to the derivative example using Fleet.

You can install any packages available in the openSUSE repositories by tweaking\n# Install packages from the base image RUN zypper in -y \\ .... # Add more packages here! System layout and k3s We set some default layouts and install k3s:\n# Install k3s server/agent ENV INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=${K3S_VERSION} RUN curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io \u003e installer.sh \u0026\u0026 \\ INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=\"true\" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=\"true\" sh installer.sh \u0026\u0026 \\ INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=\"true\" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_ENABLE=\"true\" sh installer.sh agent \u0026\u0026 \\ rm -rf installer.sh ## System layout # Required by k3s etc. RUN mkdir /usr/libexec \u0026\u0026 touch /usr/libexec/.keep # Copy custom files # COPY files/ / # Generate initrd RUN elemental init --force # OS level configuration RUN echo \"VERSION=999\" \u003e /etc/os-release RUN echo \"GRUB_ENTRY_NAME=derivative\" \u003e\u003e /etc/os-release RUN echo \"welcome to our derivative\" \u003e\u003e /etc/issue.d/01-derivative As our target here is to install k3s we do install both k3s agent and server, so the image can work in both modes. Here we could have installed any service or binary that we want to embed in our container image. We setup the system layout by creating needed paths for k3s and set up a os-release which identifies the OS version. Afterward we regenerate the initrd which is required in order to boot, see also the Initrd section.\nCloud-init, custom SSH access The cloud-init.yaml file above configures a user, joe and attaches a ssh key to it in order to login. It also sets up a default password, which is optional.\nTo specify any additional ssh key installed within the user, we do:\nnetwork: - authorized_keys: joe: - github:joe which you can replace with your github handle, or by specifying directly an ssh key. In case you specify the SSH key directly, you don’t need to run the step in the network stage.\nThe user will be part of the admin group which is allowed to use sudo.\nAs our target is to run k3s, but could have been any other service, we tweak the immutable setup by specifying sensible path required for k3s in order to function properly, see immutable rootfs for all the available options.\nFinally, we start k3s. Note, we could have tweaked that part slightly to provide k3s configurations via systemd env files, or boot up for example the agent instead of the server:\nnetwork: - if: '[ ! -f \"/run/cos/recovery_mode\" ]' name: \"Setup k3s\" # Setup environment file for custom k3s arguments environment_file: \"/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.env\" environment: FOO: \"bar\" systemctl: start: - k3s - commands: - | chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.env ","categories":"","description":"This document is a step-by-step guide to build a customized embedded system that can be used in Elemental\n","excerpt":"This document is a step-by-step guide to build a customized embedded …","ref":"/docs/examples/embedded_images/","tags":"","title":"Creating embedded images"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"This section contains various articles relative on how to customize Elemental, branding and behavior.\n","excerpt":"This section contains various articles relative on how to customize …","ref":"/docs/customizing/","tags":"","title":"Customizing"},{"body":"Requirements:\nqemu-img utility elemental binary elemental runtime dependencies The suggested approach is based on using the Elemental installer (elemental install command) to run the installation from a Linux to a loop device.

It accepts a YAML file denoting the sources to bundle in an ISO.

It is loaded form the directory specified by --config-dir elemental’s flag.\nAn example of a yaml file using the bootloader from the contained image:\niso: bootloader-in-rootfs: true grub-entry-name: \"Installer\" name: \"Elemental-0\" date: true What’s next? Check out on how to build an image from the ISO we have just created Syntax Below you can find a full reference about the yaml file format.\niso: # Sources to be installed in the rootfs rootfs: - .. # Sources to be installed in the uefi image uefi: - .. # Sources to be installed in the iso image image: - .. label: \"COS_LIVE\" Sources can be an image reference (then an explicit tag is required) or a local path. Sources are stacked in the given order, so one can easily overwrite or append data by simply adding a local path as the last source.\nCommand flags name: Name of the ISO image. It will be used to generate the *.iso file name output: Path of the destination folder of created images date: If present it includes the date in the generated file name overlay-rootfs: Sets the path of a tree to overlay on top of the system root-tree overlay-uefi: Sets the path of a tree to overaly on top of the EFI image root-tree overlay-iso: Sets the path of a tree to overlay on top of the ISO filesystem root-tree label: Sets the volume label of the ISO filesystem Configuration reference iso.rootfs A list of sources in uri format (container image or local path) [ “docker”, “oci”, “dir”, “file” ] to install in the rootfs.

It attempts to create if it doesn’t exist.\nCustomize bootloader with GRUB Boot menu and other bootloader parameters can then be easily customized by using the overlay parameters within the ISO config yaml manifest.\nAssuming the ISO being built includes:\niso: rootfs: - ... uefi: - oci:example-grub2-efi-image:latest image: - oci:example-grub2:latest - oci:example-grub2-efi-image:latest We can customize either the image packages (in the referrence image live/grub2 package includes bootloader configuration) or make use of the overlay concept to include or overwrite addition files for image section.\nConsider the following example:\niso: rootfs: - ... uefi: - oci:example-grub2-efi-image:latest image: - oci:example-grub2:latest - oci:example-grub2-efi-image:latest - dir:/my/path/to/overlay/iso With the above the ISO will also include the files under /my/path/to/overlay/iso path. To customize the boot menu parameters consider copy and modify relevant files from example-grub2:latest image. In this example the overlay folder files list could be:\n# image files for grub2 boot boot/grub2/grub.cfg Being boot/grub2/grub.cfg a custom grub2 configuration including custom boot menu entries. Consider the following grub.cfg example:\nsearch --file --set=root /boot/kernel.xz set default=0 set timeout=10 set timeout_style=menu set linux=linux set initrd=initrd if [ \"${grub_cpu}\" = \"x86_64\" -o \"${grub_cpu}\" = \"i386\" ];then if [ \"${grub_platform}\" = \"efi\" ]; then set linux=linuxefi set initrd=initrdefi fi fi set font=($root)/boot/x86_64/loader/grub2/fonts/unicode.pf2 if [ -f ${font} ];then loadfont ${font} fi menuentry \"Custom grub2 menu entry\" --class os --unrestricted { echo Loading kernel... $linux ($root)/boot/kernel.xz cdroot root=live:CDLABEL=COS_LIVE rd.live.dir=/ rd.live.squashimg=rootfs.squashfs console=tty1 console=ttyS0 rd.cos.disable echo Loading initrd... $initrd ($root)/boot/rootfs.xz } Separate recovery To make an ISO with a separate recovery image as squashfs, you can either use the default from Elemental, by adding it in the iso yaml file:\niso: rootfs: .. uefi: .. image: ... - oci:example-recovery:latest The installer will detect the squashfs file in the iso, and will use it when installing the system.

Elemental grub configuration includes three menu entries: first for the main OS system, second for the fallback OS system and a third for the recovery OS.\nFor example the main OS system menu entry could be something like:\nmenuentry \"Elemental\" --id elemental { search.fs_label COS_STATE root set img=/cOS/active.img set label=COS_ACTIVE loopback loop0 /$img set root=($root) source (loop0)/etc/cos/bootargs.cfg linux (loop0)$kernel $kernelcmd initrd (loop0)$initramfs } Kernel parameters The kernel parameters are not part of the persistent grub.cfg file stored in COS_STATE partition. Kernel parameters are sourced from the loop device of the OS image to boot. This is mainly to keep kernel parameters consistent across different potential OS images or system upgrades. Specifying default custom boot options Elemental images and its derivatives, are expected to include a /etc/cos/bootargs.cfg file which provides the definition of the following variables:\n$kernel: Path of the kernel binary $kernelcmd: Kernel parameters $initramfs: Path of the initrd binary This is the mechanism any Elemental image or Elemental derivative has to communicate its boot parameters (kernel, kernel params and initrd file) to GRUB2.\nFor example, the default Elemental bootarg.cfg file is:\nset kernel=/boot/vmlinuz if [ -n \"$recoverylabel\" ]; then # Boot arguments when the image is used as recovery set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=live:CDLABEL=$recoverylabel rd.live.dir=/ rd.live.squashimg=$img panic=5\" else # Boot arguments when the image is used as active/passive set kernelcmd=\"console=tty1 root=LABEL=$label iso-scan/filename=$img panic=5 security=selinux rd.cos.oemlabel=COS_OEM selinux=1\" fi set initramfs=/boot/initrd You can tweak that file to suit your needs if you need to specify persistent boot arguments.\nNote rd.cos.oemlabel=COS_OEM is required inside the bootargs in order to access to the /oem mount within the rootfs stage. COS_OEM is the default label for the oem partition. Grub environment variables Elemental (since v0.5.8) makes use of the GRUB2 environment block which can used to define persistent GRUB2 variables across reboots.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define the desired values.\nVariable Description next_entry Set the next reboot entry saved_entry Set the default boot entry default_menu_entry Set the name entries on the GRUB menu extra_active_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into active extra_passive_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into passive extra_recovery_cmdline Set additional boot commands when booting into recovery extra_cmdline Set additional boot commands for all entries default_fallback Sets default fallback logic For instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Note The examples below make use of the COS_STATE device, only files in the state and oem partitions will be used when booting. Default boot entry The default grub configuration loads the /grubenv of the COS_OEM partition and evaluates on next_entry variable and saved_entry variable. By default none is set.\nThe default boot entry is set to the value of saved_entry, in case the variable is not set grub just defaults to the first menu entry.\nnext_entry variable can be used to overwrite the default boot entry for a single boot. If next_entry variable is set this is only being used once, GRUB2 will unset it after reading it for the first time. This is helpful to define the menu entry to reboot to without having to make any permanent config change.\nUse grub2-editenv command line utility to define desired values.\nFor instance use the following command to reboot to recovery system only once:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=recovery Or to set the default entry to fallback system:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set saved_entry=fallback Boot menu By default Elemental and derivatives shows the default boot menu entry while booting (Elemental).\nThe grub menu entry is generated during installation and can be configured by setting GRUB_ENTRY_NAME in the /etc/os-release file inside the derivative, or either via the general configuration to specify installation details.\nFor example, specifying in /etc/elemental/config.yaml:\ninstall: ... grub-entry-name: myOS ... will automatically set the GRUB menu entries for active, passive and recovery to the specified value.\nThe grub menu boot entry can also be set with grub2-editenv:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default_menu_entry=fooOS Additional menu entries Since\nsystem/grub2-config = 0.0.3-16 it is possible to add multiple custom menu entries to GRUB by creating a /grubcustom config file in the state partition during boot. The grubcustom file will be sourced at the end of the boot process, and can contain several menuentry blocks.\nPersistent boot option flags It is possible to define persistent boot flag for each menu entry also via grub2-editenv:\nextra_active_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on active boot extra_passive_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on passive boot extra_recovery_cmdline: extra bootflags to be applied only on recovery extra_cmdline: will be applied to each boot entry Renaming partition labels During boot the GRUB2 configuration is set to load the grub_oem_env file from the state partition. In this file the following variables are set in order to find system partitions:\nstate_label: Label of state partition. active_label: Filesystem label of active image. passive_label: Filesystem label of passive image. recovery_label: Label of recovery partition. system_label: Filesystem label of recovery image. oem_label: Label of OEM partition. persistent_label: Label of persistent partition. Customizing fallback logic By default Elemental boots into active, and if there are failures will boot into the passive, and finally if keeps failing, will boot into recovery.\nIt is possible to override the default fallback logic by setting default_fallback as grub environment, consider for example:\n\u003e grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set default_fallback=\"2 0 1\" Will set the default fallback to “2 0 1” instead of the default “0 1 2”.\n","categories":"","description":"GRUB 2 Configuration\n","excerpt":"GRUB 2 Configuration\n","ref":"/docs/customizing/configure_grub/","tags":"","title":"GRUB"},{"body":"Elemental includes basic support for SELinux. From an elemental perspective SELinux is some custom configurationt that requires special treatment. Being specific it mostly nails down to apply SELinux labels at install and upgrade time. Since the rootfs is readonly they can’t be easily applied at runtime or at boot time. As consequence of that SELinux autorelabel service should not be used within elemental as it expects a RW root and persistency across reboots (it essentially reboots after appliying labels). For the time being Elemental only considers the targeted SELinux policy.\nelemental-cli utility applies SELinux contexts to the installed/upgraded system if three conditions are met:\nthe installed system includes the setfiles command the installed system includes the targeted files context (/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts file) the binary for targeted policy is also present (/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.* file) In an Elemental workflow SElinux context labels should be applied at install/upgrade time for the readonly areas, but this is not enough as it doesn’t cover the ephemeral filesystems (overlayfs on top of tmpfs), which are usually sensitive paths like /etc/, /var, /srv, etc. In order to properly apply file contexts over the ephemeral paths the relabelling has to happen at boot time once those overlayfs are created. The appropriate stage for that is in initrd before switching root. In fact, it can be done as a cloud-init step as part of the initramfs stage, using the packaged 10_selinux.yaml with:\n# Default Elemental OEM configuration file # # This file is part of Elemental and will get reset during upgrades. # # Before you change this file manually, # consider copying this file to /usr/local/cloud-config or # copy the file with a prefix starting by 90, e.g. /oem/91_custom.yaml name: \"SELinux\" stages: initramfs: - name: \"Relabelling\" commands: - | if grep -q \"selinux=1\" /proc/cmdline; then load_policy -i restorecon -R -i -v /etc /root /opt /srv /var /home /usr/local /oem fi Complete source code: https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit/blob/main/pkg/features/embedded/cloud-config-defaults/system/oem/10_selinux.yaml Note it is required to load the policy in advance to be capable to apply the restorecon command. The restorecon command should be applied to all ephemeral paths and, depending on the specific use case, to the persistent paths too. Note that without restoring context on the ephemeral /etc it is unlikely the system is capable of properly booting, hence this is a very important step if SELinux is intended to used.\nUsing custom SELinux modules Making use of selinux and including SELinux utilities and targeted policy within the base OS it is enough to get started with SELinux, however there is a great chance that this is too generic and requires some additional policy modules to be fully functional according to each specific use case.\nThe Type Enforcement file was created by booting an Elemental OS on permissive mode using audit2allow and other SELinux related utilities to generate the custom module out of the reported denials. Something like:\n# Create the type enforcement file cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m elemental \u003e elemental.te # Create the policy module checkmodule -M -m -o elemental.mod elemental.te # Create the policy package out of the module semodule_package -o elemental.pp -m elemental.mod To make effective the policy package it has to be loaded or installed within the selinux policy, this can be easily done with the semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp command. So from a derivative perspective and following the example from Creating bootable image section adding the following lines to the Dockerfile should be enough to enable SELinux in enforcing mode:\n# Install the custom policy package if any and the restore context stage in cloud-init config RUN elemental init --force --features=cloud-config # Load the policy package RUN semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp # Enable selinux in enforcing mode RUN sed -i \"s|^SELINUX=.*|SELINUX=enforcing|g\" /etc/selinux/config The above assumes the base image already includes the SELinux packages and utilities provided by the underlaying distro. It is suggested to set the enforcing mode via the config file rather than setting grub with the selinux kernel parameter (enforcing=1), this way it is easier, at any time, to temporarily add enforcing=0 at runtime within the grub2 shell and temporarily set SELinux in permissive mode.\nNotes when using a SELinux version prior to v3.4. If libsemanage version is lower than v3.4, it is likely that the semodule -i *.pp command fails with a cross-device linking issue, this is a known issue upstream and already fixed since v3.4. Command selinux -i \u003cfile\u003e mutates files under /var/lib/selinux/targeted and used to rename some files, this can be tricky when executed inside a container as hardlinks across filesystems are not permitted and this is actually what happens if the overlayfs driver is used. This can be worked around if all the originally mutated files are already modified within the execution layer (so they are part of the upper layer of the overlayfs). So the above specific example could be rewritten as:\n# Install the custom policy package if any and the restore context stage in cloud-init config RUN elemental init --force --features=cloud-config # Artificially modify selinux files to copy them in within the overlyfs and then load the policy package RUN mv /var/lib/selinux/targeted/active /var/lib/selinux/targeted/previous \u0026\u0026\\ cp --link --recursive /var/lib/selinux/targeted/previous /var/lib/selinux/targeted/active \u0026\u0026\\ semodule -i /usr/share/elemental/selinux/elemental.pp # Enable selinux in enforcing mode RUN sed -i \"s|^SELINUX=.*|SELINUX=enforcing|g\" /etc/selinux/config ","categories":"","description":"SELinux support in Elemental\n","excerpt":"SELinux support in Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/customizing/selinux_support/","tags":"","title":"SELinux Support"},{"body":"This section describes the runtime layout of a derivative (or a Elemental Vanilla image) once booted in a system.\nThe Elemental toolkit performs during installation a common setup which is equivalent across all derivatives.\nThis mechanism ensures that a layout:\nit’s simple and human friendly allows to switch easily derivatives allows to perform recovery tasks is resilient to upgrade failures Layout The basic setup consists of:\nan A/B partitioning style. We have an ‘active’ and a ‘passive’ system too boot from in case of failures a Recovery system which allows to perform emergency tasks in case of failure of the ‘A/B’ partitions a Fallback mechanism that boots the partitions in this sequence: “A -\u003e B -\u003e Recovery” in case of booting failures The upgrade happens in a transition image and take places only after all the necessary steps are completed. An upgrade of the ‘A/B’ partitions can be done by booting into them and running elemental upgrade. This will create a new pristine image that will be selected as active for the next reboot, the old one will be flagged as passive. If we are performing the same from the passive system, only the active is subject to changes.\nSimilarly, a recovery system can be upgraded as well by running elemental upgrade --recovery. This will upgrade the recovery system instead of the active/passive. Note both commands needs to be run inside the active or passive system.\nPartitions The default partitioning is created during installation and is expected to be present in a booted Elemental system:\na COS_STATE partition that will contain our active, passive and recovery images. The images are located under the /cOS directory a COS_PERSISTENT partition which contains the persistent user data. This directory is mounted over /usr/local during runtime a COS_OEM partition which contains the cloud-init oem files, which is mounted over /oem during runtime a COS_RECOVERY partition which contains the recovery system image The COS_STATE partitions contains the active, passive . While the active and passive are .img files which are loopback mounted, the recovery system is in COS_RECOVERY and can also be a squashfs file (provided in /cOS/recovery.squashfs). This ensures the immutability aspect and ease out building derivative in constrained environments (e.g. when we have restricted permissions and we can’t mount).\nFor more information about the immutability aspect of Elemental, see Immutable rootfs\n","categories":"","description":"Runtime layout of a booted Elemental derivative\n","excerpt":"Runtime layout of a booted Elemental derivative\n","ref":"/docs/reference/layout/","tags":"","title":"Runtime layout"},{"body":"Elemental and every derivative can upgrade, rollback or just switch to different versions in runtime by using the toolkit installed inside the image.\nTo upgrade an installed system, just run elemental upgrade and reboot.\nThis will perform an upgrade based on the default derivative configuration for the image. See general configuration on how to configure defaults when building a derivative.\n“Upgrades” are not carried over the usual way of treating each single package individually: Elemental considers the container image as a new system where to boot into. It will pull a new container image during this phase, which will be booted on the next reboot.\nUpgrade to a specific container image To specify a specific container image to upgrade to instead of the regular upgrade channels, run elemental upgrade --system.uri imagei-uri.\nNote by default elemental upgrade --system.uri runs an mtree checksum verificatiom (requires images manifests generated with mtree separately). To disable image checksum verification, run elemental upgrade --verify --system.uri.\nIntegration with System Upgrade Controller If running a kubernetes cluster on the Elemental system, you can leverage the system-upgrade-controller to trigger upgrades to specific image versions, for example:\n--- apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind: Plan metadata: name: elemental-upgrade namespace: system-upgrade labels: k3s-upgrade: server spec: concurrency: 1 version: fleet-sample # Image tag nodeSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: k3s.io/hostname, operator: Exists} serviceAccountName: system-upgrade cordon: true # drain: # force: true upgrade: image: quay.io/costoolkit/test-images # Image upgrade reference command: - \"/usr/sbin/suc-upgrade\" See also trigger upgrades with fleet\nFrom ISO The ISO can be also used as a recovery medium: type elemental upgrade from a LiveCD. It will then try to upgrade the image of the active partition installed in the system.\nHow it works Elemental during installation sets two .img images files in the COS_STATE partition:\n/cOS/active.img labeled COS_ACTIVE: Where Elemental typically boots from /cOS/passive.img labeled COS_PASSIVE: Where Elemental boots for fallback Those are used by the upgrade mechanism to prepare and install a pristine Elemental each time an upgrade is attempted.\n","categories":"","description":"How to run upgrades in Elemental\n","excerpt":"How to run upgrades in Elemental\n","ref":"/docs/getting-started/upgrading/","tags":"","title":"Upgrading"},{"body":" Section under construction.\nWhile building a derivative, or on a running system things can go really wrong, the guide is aimed to give tips while building derivatives and also debugging running systems.\nDon’t forget tocheck the known issues for the release you’re using.\nBefore booting, several kernel parameters can be used to help during debugging (also when booting an ISO). Those are meant to be used only while debugging, and they might defeat the concept of immutability.\nDisable Immutability By adding rd.cos.debugrw to the boot parameters read only mode will be disabled. See Immutable setup for more options.\nThe derivative will boot into RW mode, that means any change made during runtime will persist across reboots. Use this feature with caution as defeats the concept of immutability.\nrd.cos.debugrw applies only to active and passive partitions. The recovery image can’t be mutated.\nNote The changes made will persist during reboots but won’t persist across upgrades. If you need to persist changes across upgrades in runtime (for example by adding additional packages on top of the derivative image), see how to apply persistent changes. Debug initramfs issues As derivative can ship and build their own initrd, the official debug docs contains valid information that can be used for troubleshooting.\nFor example:\nrd.break=pre-mount rd.shell: Drop a shell before setting up mount points rd.break=pre-pivot rd.shell: Drop a shell before switch-root Recovery partition If you can boot into the system, the recovery partition can be used to reset the state of the active/passive, but can also be used to upgrade to specific images. Be sure to read the Recovery section in the docs.\nMutating derivative images It can be useful to mutate derivative images and commit a container’s file changes or settings into a new image. This allows you to debug a container by running an interactive shell, and re-use the mutated image in Elemental systems. Generally, it is better to use Dockerfiles to manage your images in a documented and maintainable way. Read more about creating bootable images.\nLet’s suppose we have the derivative original image at $IMAGE and we want to mutate it. We will push it later with another name $NEW_IMAGE and use it to our node downstream.\nRun the derivative image locally, and perform any necessary change (e.g. add additional software):\n$\u003e docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash -ti --name updated-image $IMAGE Commit any changes to a new image $NEW_IMAGE:\n$\u003e docker commit updated-image $NEW_IMAGE And push the image to the container registry:\n$\u003e docker push $NEW_IMAGE In the derivative then it’s sufficient to upgrade to that image with elemental upgrade:\n$\u003e elemental upgrade --docker-image $NEW_IMAGE Adding login keys at boot To add users key from the GRUB menu prompt, edit the boot cmdline and add the following kernel parameters:\nstages.boot[0].authorized_keys.root[0]=github:suse\n","categories":"","description":"Stuff can go wrong.
